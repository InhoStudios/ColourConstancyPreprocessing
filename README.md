# ColourConstancyPreprocessing
Apply Grey World colour constancy model onto images

For pre-processing images, put all images as .jpg format in the `images` folder. Run `main.m`, and the exported copy of the images will be saved in `exports/greyworld` and `exports/shadesofgrey` respectively, as .jpg images. 

Files will save under their original filename but not under their original file hierarchy. Images with the same name under different folders will not export properly.
