# ColourConstancyPreprocessing
Apply Grey World colour constancy model onto images

For pre-processing images, put all images as .jpg format in the images folder (no subfolders, I'm working on getting subdirectories working). Run `main.m`, and the exported copy of the images will be saved in `export-greyworld-images` and `export-shadesofgrey-images` respectively, as .jpg images.
